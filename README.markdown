#Statistics
Compute the mean, standard deviation and extrema for a number of samples.
All calculations are done online as samples are added.

###The formulas are:
* Mean:
```
sum(samples) / n
```
* Variance:
```
sum((sample - mean)^2) / (n - 1)
```
* Standard Deviation:
```
sqrt(variance)
```
* Min & Max are the minimum and maximum values of the samples.
